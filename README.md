# LessPass

LessPass is a stateless password manager.

Stop wasting your time synchronizing your encrypted vault. Remember one master password to access your passwords, anywhere, anytime. No sync needed. Try the demo at [www.lesspass.com](https://www.lesspass.com).

## :rotating_light: information

LessPass Database server will be turned off on March 1th, 2023. [Read here why](https://blog.lesspass.com/2022-12-29/decommissioning-lesspass-database)

However, shutting down the database server does not prevent you from continuing to use the functionality if you deploy your own server. You can:
- Install some lightweight alternative of the API server for personal use. [Here is a list](https://github.com/lesspass/lesspass/wiki/Third-party-implementations-of-LessPass#api-servers).
- [Install the server software](https://github.com/lesspass/lesspass/wiki/Hosting-LessPass-behind-your-own-proxy) (most recommended in installations for many clients).
